# 🌱 Kerala Fertilizer Recommendation System

---

## 🌾 Overview

The **Kerala Fertilizer Recommendation System** is a machine learning–powered web application that provides **personalized fertilizer recommendations** based on soil conditions, crop type, season, and nutrient levels.  
It is specifically designed for **Kerala’s agricultural environment**, considering its acidic soils, common crops, and regional farming practices.

The system recommends:
- ✅ **Best-suited fertilizer**
- ✅ **Optimal fertilizer quantity (kg/acre)**
- ✅ **Application guidance**
- ✅ **Estimated cost analysis**

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end ML workflow** — from data generation and model training to real-world deployment using a web interface.
